Note: 
1. this work has been done in DFKI, Kaiserslautern, Germany, as a part of the DFG research project "Scalable Methods of Text and Structure Recognition for the Full-Text Digitization of Historical Prints" Part 1.B: Image Optimization"

2. The parameters values are read from ocrd-anybaseocr-parameter.json file. The values can be changed in that file.
3. The command line IO usage is based on "OCR-D" project guidelines (https://ocr-d.github.io/). 
4. The sequence of operations is: binarization, deskewing, cropping and dewarping (or can also be: binarization, dewarping, deskewing, and cropping; depends upon use-case).
5. Sample files are available at [OCR-D/assets](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd-assets/tree/master/data/dfki-testdata)

# Method Behaviour
This function takes a document image as input and make the text line straight if its curved.
